            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated on the night of October 31st. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, where people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. Today, Halloween is associated with activities like trick-or-treating, costume parties, carving pumpkins, and more.</p>

            <h2>History of Halloween</h2>
            <p>The history of Halloween dates back over 2,000 years to the Celtic festival of Samhain, marking the end of the harvest and the beginning of winter. The Celts believed that on the night before November 1st, the boundary between the living and the dead blurred, and ghosts returned to earth.</p>
            <p>As time went on, Halloween evolved with influences from Roman and Christian traditions, becoming more of a community-based holiday focused on fun, games, and food. By the early 20th century, Halloween had become a secular but still community-centered holiday, especially in the United States.</p>

            <h2>Why Costumes?</h2>
            <p>The tradition of dressing up in costumes for Halloween stems from the ancient Celts who believed that wearing costumes would help them blend in with spirits and avoid harm. Today, costumes are worn for fun and creativity, and they are a major part of modern Halloween celebrations.</p>
