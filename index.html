            <h2>The Origins of Halloween</h2>
            <p>Halloweenâ€™s origins date back over 2,000 years to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. The Celts, who lived in what is now Ireland, celebrated their new year on November 1st. On the night of October 31st, they believed the boundary between the living and the dead blurred, and ghosts of the dead returned to earth.</p>
            <p>The festival involved bonfires, costumes, and sacrifices to deities. Over time, as the Romans conquered Celtic lands, they adopted and blended these traditions with their own festivals.</p>

            <h2>The Origins of Costumes</h2>
            <p>Costumes have been a part of Halloween for centuries, dating back to the belief that wearing disguises could help hide individuals from spirits. Today, costumes are worn not to ward off spirits, but for fun. Popular costumes have evolved over the years, from witches and ghosts to superheroes and fictional characters.</p>
            <p>Costumes provide a chance for self-expression, letting people transform into someoneâ€”or somethingâ€”else, even if just for one night.</p>
